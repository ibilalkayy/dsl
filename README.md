# 🛠️ DSL — A Simple Custom Language

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A command-line tool to **parse**, **render**, **lint**, and **work with a custom domain-specific language (DSL)**. Ideal for learning how parsers work and transforming custom text-based formats into structured outputs like JSON, HTML, or Markdown.

> 🚀 Built in Rust — fast, safe, and fun!

## 📦 Features

- 🔍 `parse` — Convert DSL files into JSON or debug formats
- 🖼️ `render` — Render DSL content to HTML, plaintext, or Markdown
- 🧹 `lint` — Check DSL syntax and report common issues
- 🔁 `watch` — Watch files for changes and auto-parse/render
- 🛠️ `init` — Scaffold a starter DSL project
- ✅ `validate` — Validate DSL syntax (CI/CD-friendly)
- 🧪 `test` — Run tests on DSL files against expected outputs
- 📤 `export` — Export your DSL's schema/spec
