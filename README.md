# 🛠️ DSL — A Simple Custom Language

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This is a fun and educational project focused on building your own **domain-specific language (DSL)** — a small custom syntax for either configuration (like TOML/YAML) or content formatting (like Markdown). The goal is to define your own mini-language, parse it, and use it to produce structured data or HTML output.

## 📌 Features

- Define your own syntax and rules
- Parse input files using your DSL
- Output to structured data or transformed formats
- Learn about text processing, file I/O, and parsers

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibilalkayy/dsl.git
   cd dsl
